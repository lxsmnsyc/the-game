# Passive Abilities

- Each `Passive Ability` has a maximum level of 10.
- Once the `Player`, `Boss` or `Mini-boss` reached the `Passive Ability` level cap on all available `Passive Ability`, the level cap for all `Passive Ability` is increased by 10. This process repeats.

## Player

- `Player` gains 1 `Passive Ability` level per `Player` level.

## Boss

- `Passive Ability` level points are applied randomly.

## Miniboss

- `Miniboss` are given 3 random `Passive Ability` and gains 5 `Passive Ability` level per `Floor` level.
- `Passive Ability` level points are applied randomly.
