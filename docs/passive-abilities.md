# Passive Abilities

- Each `Passive Ability` has a maximum level of 10.
- Once the `Player`, `Boss` or `Mini-boss` reached the `Passive Ability` level cap on all available `Passive Ability`, the level cap for all `Passive Ability` is increased by 10. This process repeats.

## Player

## Boss

- `Boss` are given 10 random `Passive Ability`.

## Miniboss
