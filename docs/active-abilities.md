# Active Abilities

- Each `Active Ability` has a maximum level of 10.
- Once the `Player`, `Boss` or `Mini-boss` reached the `Active Ability` level cap on all available `Active Ability`, the level cap for all `Active Ability` is increased by 10. This process repeats.

## Player

- `Player` gains 1 `Active Ability` level per `Player` level.

## Boss

- `Active Ability` level points are applied randomly.

## Miniboss

- `Miniboss` are given 3 random `Active Ability` and gains 5 `Active Ability` level per `Floor` level.
- `Active Ability` level points are applied randomly.
