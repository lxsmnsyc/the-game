# Floor

- A `Floor` is where the game takes place.
- `Player` starts at Floor 0.
- A `Floor` game-time lasts for 5 minutes.
- Game-time is stuck at 5 minutes until the `Boss` has been killed.
- Once a `Floor` ends, the next `Floor` level is unlocked and the player is moved automatically.
- An unlocked `Floor` level can be resumed by the `Player` when starting the game.
- When starting with an unlocked `Floor` level, levels are adjusted automatically and the `Player` is rewarded with the correct amount of `Weapon`, `Active Ability` and `Passive Ability` level point.
- When starting a `Floor`, the `Player` must start the game manually first before the game-time starts ticking.
- When the `Player` is moved to the next `Floor` level, game still continues.
